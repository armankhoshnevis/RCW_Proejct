Function Constitutive_Model(problem, params)
    This function calculates the storage and loss modules of a constitutive model
    for different branch configurations (FMG-FMG, FMM-FMG, FMG-FMM, FMM-FMM).
    
    Inputs:
        - problem: a structure containing frequency data
        - params: an array of model parameters

    Process:
        1. Extract parameters for both branches from 'params'.
        2. Precompute mathematical terms (e.g., cosine, sine) for efficiency.
        3. For each frequency in the problem data:
           a. Calculate the storage module (E') based on the parameters.
           b. Calculate the loss module (E'') based on the parameters.
        4. Store the computed storage and loss modules back into 'problem'.

    Output:
        - problem: updated with calculated storage and loss modules.
