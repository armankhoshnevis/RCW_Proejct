Function Cost_Function(problem, params)
    This function calculates a multi-objective cost value (cost) by comparing the
    experimental data with model predictions in a logarithm scale.

    Inputs:
        - problem: a structure providing experimental data, model data, and 
        weights
        - params: an array of model parameters

    Process:
        1. Update the model predictions in 'problem' by calling 
        'Constitutive_Model' with given 'params'.
        2. Calculate the squared error (f1) between the log-transformed 
        experimental and model data for the storage module.
        3. Calculate the squared error (f2) between the log-transformed 
        experimental and model data for the loss module.
        4. Combine f1 and f2 using the weights specified in 'problem' to 
        calculate the final cost value (cost).

    Output:
        - cost: the weighted objective value representing the fit of the model to
        the experimental data.
