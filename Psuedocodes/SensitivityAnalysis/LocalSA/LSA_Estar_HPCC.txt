This script performs a derivative-based local sensitivity analysis for the storage and loss moduli.

Inputs:
    - Optimized values for the model parameters (Ec1, tauc1, alpha1, beta1, Ec2, tauc2, and alpha2)

Outputs:
    - Mean and standard deviation of local sensitivity coefficients over decades of frequency.

Steps:
1. Define Model Parameters as Symbols:
    - Declare symbolic variables for characteristic moduli (Ec1, Ec2), time scales (tc1, tc2), power-law exponents (a1, a2, b1), and frequency (w).

2. Compute Storage and Loss Moduli for Each Branch:
    - Formulate symbolic expressions for the storage and loss moduli for the first and second branches (Ep1, Ep2, Epp1, Epp2).
    - Calculate the combined storage and loss moduli (Ep and Epp) as the sum of both branches' contributions.

3. Convert Symbolic Expressions to MATLAB Functions:
    - Generate MATLAB functions for Ep and Epp.
    - Compute partial derivatives of Ep and Epp with respect to each model parameter.
    - Convert these derivatives to MATLAB functions for sensitivity analysis.

4. Load Experimental Data and Initialize Parameters:
    - Load the experimental data and optimized model parameters values.
    - Set the mean values to the optimized model parameters and the standard deviation is a fixed percentage of the mean.
    - Calculate parameter bounds for each variable assuming a uniform distribution.

5. Monte Carlo Simulation (N_MC realizations):
    - For each realization:
        a. Sample random values for each model parameter within its bounds.
        b. Compute storage and loss moduli (Ep_vctr and Epp_vctr) for the sampled parameters.
        c. Calculate normalized sensitivity coefficients for each parameter concerning the magnitude of the complex modulus using the parameter samples and frequency range.
        
        - Log the iteration index for progress tracking.

6. Compute Mean and Standard Deviation of Sensitivity Coefficients:
    - Calculate the mean and standard deviation across all realizations and frequencies for each sensitivity coefficient.
    - Store these computed values in arrays for further analysis.

7. Save Results:
    - Save the mean and standard deviation results for the sensitivity coefficients across frequencies to a .mat file for later use.
