1. Import Required Libraries and Set Up Analysis Environment:
    - Import libraries for numerical operations, data handling, and plotting.
    - Import functions from SALib for Sobol sampling and sensitivity analysis.

2. Define Functions for Storage and Loss Moduli (Ep and Epp):
    - Implement `Ep_func` and `Epp_func` to calculate the storage and loss moduli, respectively, given frequency and model parameters.

3. Load Experimental Data and Set Model Parameters:
    - Load mean parameter values from an Excel file.
    - Define the frequency range for analysis.
    - Select a specific dataset index based on the GnP percentage.
    - Calculate parameter ranges (lower and upper limits) based on standard deviations.

4. Evaluate Storage and Loss Moduli Over the Frequency Range:
    - Calculate storage (Ep_model) and loss (Epp_model) moduli across frequencies using the defined functions and mean values.
    - Compute the complex modulus (Ecomplex_model) from Ep and Epp.

5. Define the Sensitivity Analysis Problem:
    - Specify model parameter bounds and names for Sobol sensitivity analysis.

6. Perform Sobol Sensitivity Analysis for Multiple Realization Counts:
    - For each predefined number of realizations:
        a. Generate samples of model parameters using Sobol sampling.
        b. Modify samples to respect parameter constraints.
        c. Evaluate the complex modulus at each frequency for each sample set.
        d. Perform Sobol sensitivity analysis for each frequency and compute Sobol indices for the complex modulus.
        e. Extract first-order and total-order sensitivity indices and their confidence intervals.

7. Save Sensitivity Analysis Results to Excel:
    - Save the calculated first-order and total-order Sobol indices and confidence intervals for each frequency and realization count in separate Excel files.

8. Visualize Sensitivity Analysis Results (for S1 and ST of E*):
    - Load saved Sobol indices from Excel files.
    - Set up subplots to visualize the first-order (S1) and total-order (ST) indices for the complex modulus across frequencies and parameter variations.
    - Configure subplot layouts and labels, customizing axes and ticks for log-scaled frequency.

9. Display Visualizations:
    - Arrange and display the subplots with appropriate labels, legends, and confidence intervals to represent the sensitivity of model parameters on the complex modulus across the frequency range.
