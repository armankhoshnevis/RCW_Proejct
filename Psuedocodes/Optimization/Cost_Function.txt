Function Cost_Function(problem, params)
    This function calculates a multi-objective cost value (cost) by comparing the
    experimental data with model predictions in a logarithm scale.

    Inputs:
        - problem: a structure providing
            - Experimental data
            - Model data
            - Weights
        - params: an array of model parameters
            - Ec1: Characteristic modulus of the first branch
            - tauc1: Characteristic relaxation time of the first branch
            - alpha1: Power exponent of the first spring-pot element in the first branch (Both FMG and FMM models)
            - beta1: Power exponent of the second spring-pot element in the first branch (Unique for FMM Model)
            - Ec2: Characteristic modulus of the second branch
            - tauc2: Characteristic relaxation time of the second branch
            - alpha2: Power exponent of the first spring-pot element in the first branch (FMG model)

    Process:
        1. Update the model predictions in 'problem' by calling 
        'Constitutive_Model' with given 'params'.
        2. Calculate the squared error (f1) between the log-transformed 
        experimental and model data for the storage module.
        3. Calculate the squared error (f2) between the log-transformed 
        experimental and model data for the loss module.
        4. Combine f1 and f2 using the weights specified in 'problem' to 
        calculate the final cost value (cost).

    Output:
        - cost: the weighted objective value representing the fit of the model to
        the experimental data.
