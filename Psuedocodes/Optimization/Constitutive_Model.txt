Function Constitutive_Model(problem, params)
    This function calculates the storage and loss modules of a constitutive model
    for different branch configurations (FMG-FMG, FMM-FMG, FMG-FMM, FMM-FMM).
    
    Inputs:
        - problem: a structure containing frequency data
            - problem.modelData(1,:): Experimental frequency data points
            
        - params: an array of model parameters
            - Ec1: Characteristic modulus of the first branch
            - tauc1: Characteristic relaxation time of the first branch
            - alpha1: Power exponent of the first spring-pot element in the first branch (Both FMG and FMM models)
            - beta1: Power exponent of the second spring-pot element in the first branch (Unique for FMM Model)
            - Ec2: Characteristic modulus of the second branch
            - tauc2: Characteristic relaxation time of the second branch
            - alpha2: Power exponent of the first spring-pot element in the first branch (FMG model)

    Process:
        1. Extract parameters for both branches from 'params'.
        2. Precompute mathematical terms (e.g., cosine, sine) for efficiency.
        3. For each frequency in the problem data:
           a. Calculate the storage module (E') based on the parameters.
           b. Calculate the loss module (E'') based on the parameters.
        4. Store the computed storage and loss modules back into 'problem'.

    Output:
        - problem: updated with calculated storage and loss modules.
