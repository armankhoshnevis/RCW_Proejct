# Explanation

This section provides high-level overviews of MATLAB scripts and functions available in the GitHub repository.

- [`main_loop_hpcc_function.m`](main_loop_hpcc_function.md): Runs the PSO optimization process and saves results.
- [`PSO.m`](PSO.md): Implements the PSO optimization algorithm.
- [`Constitutive_Model.m`](Constitutive_Model.md): Calculates the equivalent storage and loss moduli of the constitutive model.
- [`Cost_Function.m`](Cost_Function.md): Calculates the multi-objective cost function for the optimization.
- [`metadata.dat`](metadata.md): Sets up the optimization params.
